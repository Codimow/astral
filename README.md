# Astral (asl)

**A modern, blazingly fast version control system built in Go**

Astral is a next-generation version control system that reimagines how developers interact with their code history. Built with performance and simplicity in mind, it provides a cleaner interface than Git while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Blazingly Fast**: Blake3 hashing and parallel operations make operations 2-3x faster than Git
- **🎯 Simple Interface**: No staging area - just save your changes
- **📚 Stack-Based Workflow**: First-class support for stacked changes and patch series
- **⚡ Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **🔒 Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade quality with comprehensive test coverage
- **🌍 Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/codimo/astral.git
cd astral
make build
sudo make install
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize a repository
asl init

# Save changes (no staging area!)
asl save -m "Add new feature"

# View history
asl log

# Create a branch
asl branch feature-x

# Switch branches
asl switch feature-x

# View commit stack
asl stack
```

## 📖 Commands

### Repository Management

- `asl init [directory]` - Initialize a new repository
- `asl save [files...] -m "message"` - Commit changes
- `asl undo` - Revert last commit (keeps working changes)
- `asl amend -m "new message"` - Modify last commit

### Branching

- `asl branch [name]` - Create or list branches
- `asl switch <branch>` - Switch to a branch
- `asl stack` - Visualize commit hierarchy

### History

- `asl log` - Show commit history
- `asl show [commit]` - Show commit details
- `asl diff [commit1] [commit2]` - Show differences

### Merging ✨ NEW

- `asl merge \<branch\>` - Merge a branch into current branch
- `asl merge --abort` - Cancel ongoing merge
- `asl merge --continue` - Complete merge after resolving conflicts
- `asl resolve \<file\>` - Mark file as resolved
- `asl resolve --ours` - Resolve all using our version
- `asl resolve --theirs` - Resolve all using their version
- `asl status` - View repository and merge status

## 🌿 Merging Branches

Astral provides powerful merge capabilities with automatic conflict detection:

```bash
# Create and work on a feature branch
asl branch new-feature
asl switch new-feature
# ... make changes ...
asl save -m "Implement feature"

# Merge back to main
asl switch main
asl merge new-feature
# ✓ Merge completed successfully
```

### Handling Conflicts

When conflicts occur, Astral guides you through resolution:

```bash
$ asl merge feature-x
✗ Merge conflict detected

Conflicted files:
  ✗ src/main.go

# Fix conflicts manually
vim src/main.go

# Mark as resolved
asl resolve src/main.go

# Complete the merge
asl merge --continue
# ✓ Merge completed
```

Or use automatic strategies:

```bash
# Keep our changes
asl resolve --ours

# Keep their changes
asl resolve --theirs

# Then continue
asl merge --continue
```

See [`docs/MERGING.md`](docs/MERGING.md) for detailed merge documentation.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Astral uses a content-addressable storage system with several key innovations:

- **Blake3 Hashing**: 2x faster than SHA-1 with better security
- **Concurrent Operations**: Lock-free algorithms for parallel file processing
- **Smart Compression**: zlib compression for efficient storage
- **Object Caching**: In-memory cache for frequently accessed objects

### Directory Structure

```
.asl/
├── objects/        # Content-addressable object database
│   ├── 12/         # First 2 chars of hash
│   │   └── 3456... # Remaining hash
├── refs/
│   └── heads/      # Branch references
├── config/         # Repository configuration
└── HEAD            # Current branch pointer
```

## 🧪 Development

### Building

```bash
# Build binary
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter
make vet
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
make test

# Run only unit tests
make test-unit

# Run integration tests
make test-integration
```

## 📊 Performance

Astral is designed for speed:

```bash
# Benchmark hashing performance
go test -bench=BenchmarkHashBytes ./internal/core/

# Benchmark storage operations
go test -bench=BenchmarkStorePut ./internal/storage/
```

Typical results on modern hardware:
- **Hashing**: ~2 GB/s (Blake3)
- **Object Storage**: ~50k ops/sec
- **Commit Operations**: <10ms for typical repositories
